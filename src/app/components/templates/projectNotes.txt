The following checklist to consider when DEPLOYING to PRODUCTION:

1) ensure that ng-include urls are 'app/xxx/xxx' and not '../app/xxx/xxx'
the ../ does not compile properly in production and views don't always display

2) imported scss scripts must not be css. Convert imported css to scss extensions
